# React Phone catalog
Developed to reinforce skills, for self-improvement, and without a commercial purpose.
During the project development, HTML, SCSS, and React/TypeScript were used.

Additionally, external libraries were utilized, such as [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) for easy class management and [react-spinners](https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/) for displaying loading indicators.

The project is built on functional components.
[Context](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) is used for managing the application state and passing data between multiple components without the need to pass props through all intermediate components. 

[BEM](https://en.bem.info/) (Block Element Modifier) methodology was used in the website development, allowing the creation of independent website blocks that could be reused.
